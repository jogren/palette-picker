Palette Picker is a full-stack web application in which users can browse hex codes, create color palettes, and save them to a specific project. All projects and palettes are stored in a database and available upon page refresh. This app was created in less than 2 weeks with React/Redux on the frontend and Node/Express/Knex on the backend. 

The app is deployed at: https://palette-picker-sfjo.herokuapp.com.
